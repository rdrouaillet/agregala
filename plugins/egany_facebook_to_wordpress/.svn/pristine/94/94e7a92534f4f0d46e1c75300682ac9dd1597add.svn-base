Pull your Facebook group/page feed to WordPress  

== Description ==  

A simple plugin that imports posts from **public** Facebook group/pages to your WordPress blog, every half hour!  

= What it does & doesn't =  

* Imports from Facebook group/page and inserts as `egany_fb2wp_post` post type  
* No chance for duplication
* It imports comments as well
* Runs every half hour via WordPress cron system
* Adds group id, author name and ID, post link as post meta
* If you want to check the importing manually, go to `http://example.com/?fb2wp_test`
* Import historical (paginated) posts. To do this, go to `http://example.com/?fb2wp_type=all` (import page & group) 
or '...?fb2wp_type=page'(for doing import only PAGE)
or '...?fb2wp_type=group'(for doing import only GROUP) 
Then it'll automatically start the import process. Note: Only admins can run this task.
